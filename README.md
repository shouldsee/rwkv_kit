Roadmap

- Notations
  - v:hidden state
  - y:downstream tokens
  - x:upstream tokens
- understand the property of P(y|v)
  - estimate the entropy of the distribution? 
- understand how varying upstream entities would change P(v|x)
  - what is the suitable model for the holistic relation between two objects y = r(x)?
- entity patching
  - can I patch the states so that the model returns information about specific objects/concepts?
